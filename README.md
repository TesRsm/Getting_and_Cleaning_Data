# run_analysis.R
The script has not strictly followed the order from step 1 to step 5 for obtaining the tidy data set.
The first part of the script is to read the raw data file into R. As the column names of the data are all by default, the second part of the script is to rename the dataset. Then cbind and rbind functions are used to merge the data into one dataframe and order function is used to reorder the observations by the subject number and activities. In order to find the variables which contains "mean()" and "std()", grep is used. After that a for loop is used to replace the activity code with descriptive activity name. In the last part of the script, "reshape2" package is loaded. Split by the second variable "Subject" outputs a list which contains different subjects' data in different elemnts of the list. Then a for loop is used to melt the data and a dcast function is used to reshape it with the average of each variable for each activity. The output is added to dataframe "outcome" by the subjects' numeric order. As the reshape process doesn't have the variable "Subject", the subject number is added to the first column of the output data and character "averge-" is added to the front of the corresponding variables names.
